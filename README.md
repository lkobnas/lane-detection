# Self-Driving Sim: Enhancing Lane Detection and Steering Control
![](/media/banner-gif.gif)
## Background
Self-driving technology has emerged as a groundbreaking frontier in the automotive industry, revolutionising transportation with its potential to enhance road safety and efficiency. One crucial aspect of self-driving technology is **lane-keeping**, which enables vehicles to stay within designated road lanes while maintaining a safe and smooth trajectory. Lane-keeping technology utilises computer vision algorithms and machine learning techniques to process real-time visual data from the vehicle's cameras. By detecting lane markings and analysing road conditions, the self-driving system can precisely control the steering and ensure the vehicle remains within its intended lane.
